abstract = {One of the most cited books in physics of all time, Quantum
            Computation and Quantum Information remains the best textbook in
            this exciting field of science. This 10th anniversary edition
            includes an introduction from the authors setting the work in
            context. This comprehensive textbook describes such remarkable
            effects as fast quantum algorithms, quantum teleportation, quantum
            cryptography and quantum error-correction. Quantum mechanics and
            computer science are introduced before moving on to describe what a
            quantum computer is, how it can be used to solve problems faster
            than 'classical' computers and its real-world implementation. It
            concludes with an in-depth treatment of quantum information.
            Containing a wealth of figures and exercises, this well-known
            textbook is ideal for courses on the subject, and will interest
            beginning graduate students and researchers in physics, computer
            science, mathematics, and electrical engineering.}
